Amy Larson is a geospatial science and data professional with a decade of industry specific experience, whose work is focused on digital product design and delivery; data analysis, collection, and management; and process automation.

When not on the clock, you will find her tinkering with some low-code/no-code tech to automate mundane tasks and routines like family calendars, secret Santa name generators, and the like. Or, roaming the river valleys of SE MN with her family.
